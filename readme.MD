# Data Structures and Algorithms using Python3
Each .py file contains description in itself in the form of comments. I have used Naive as well as efficient methods to improvise Algorithms.
Few .py files contain Abstract Data Structures implementations.
These are basic Algorithms using DataStructures like Arrays, LinkedLists, Sets, etc. As time flies I'll keep updating the new and competetive Algorithms.
